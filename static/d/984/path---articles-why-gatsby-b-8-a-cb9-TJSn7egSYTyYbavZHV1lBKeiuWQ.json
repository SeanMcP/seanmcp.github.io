However, I’m not interested in paying for a platform at this time.</p>\n<h3>Wordpress</h3>\n<p>Story time. When I was in high school, I started a web design and development company with a classmate. My partner quickly picked up Wordpress development and wanted to use it on all our projects. But try as I might, I couldn’t figure it out.
