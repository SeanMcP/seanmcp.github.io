On morning in the fall of 2010, I left the dorm and biked my shaggy-headed self to the local barber. He charged me \$10.00 for a simple haircut with the clippers, and I left a two-dollars tip.

As I stepped out of the door and felt the cool breeze across my freshly shorn head, I thought to myself:

> I'm never going to pay for a haircut again.

I now realize that $12.00 is a bargain for a haircut, but my college budget wouldn't allow it. And even in the years following graduation, I never found myself with$20 laying around for a hair cut.

That was eight years ago now, and I haven't--to the best of my recollection--been to the barber since. (I had planned to go before my wedding in 2014 but put it off too long and wound up cutting it myself the day before)
